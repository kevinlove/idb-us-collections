Wetzel","Curator","mjwetzel@illinois.edu","The INHS Annelida Collection is perhaps the largest state collection of freshwater oligochaetes in the country, holding 350,000 specimens (over 7,000 lots, or collections). Approximately 225,000 specimens are permanently mounted on microscope slides; the remaining specimens are stored in alcohol in vials and jars. With the exception of one monospecific order - Acanthobdellida (the bristle worms, restricted in distribution to the boreal regions in the Arctic) - the collection includes representatives of the other groups of worms in the phylum Annelida: Branchiobdellida (one family, Branchiobdellidae - the crayfish worms, including representatives of the subfamilies Bdellodrilinae, Cambarincolinae, and Xironodrilinae); Hirudinida (the leeches, including representatives in five families – Haemopidae, Hirudinidae, Erpobdellidae, Glossiphoniidae, and Piscicolidae); the Oligochaetous Clitellata {'Oligochaeta'}, with representatives of the aquatic microdrile worms (families Enchytraeidae, Haplotaxidae, Lumbriculidae, Naididae {now including the subfamilies in the former family Tubificidae}, and Opistocystidae), and the terrestrial megadrile oligochaetes – earthworms (families Acanthodrilidae, Glossoscolecidae, Komarekionidae, Lumbricidae, Megascolecidae, and Sparganophilidae); and Polychaeta (sand worms, tube worms, or clam worms – primarily marine) including a few representatives of the families Capitellidae and Sabellidae, and Aeolosomatida (one family, Aeolosomatidae – the head-crawling, or suction-feeding worms). 
Acquisition Highlights. An important acquisition for the INHS Annelida Collection in 1986 was the Walter J. Harman collection of terrestrial oligochaetes. The material in this collection, comprised of 1,600 earthworm specimens representing 22 species, 10 genera, and 3 families, was collected by Dr. Harman from 230 sites in central Illinois during his 1956-1958 survey for his doctoral work at the University of Illinois. The information in Harman's thesis, previously unpublished records in Harman's original field notes, and records of other terrestrial oligochaetes collected over the years in Illinois and deposited in the INHS Annelida Collection were recently presented in a publication by Reynolds and Wetzel (2011): Megadrilogica 18 (4): 35-67.

&entry.879476273=The INHS Annelida Collection is perhaps the largest state collection of freshwater oligochaetes in the country, holding 350,000 specimens (over 7,000 lots, or collections). Approximately 225,000 specimens are permanently mounted on microscope slides; the remaining specimens are stored in alcohol in vials and jars. With the exception of one monospecific order - Acanthobdellida (the bristle worms, restricted in distribution to the boreal regions in the Arctic) - the collection includes representatives of the other groups of worms in the phylum Annelida: Branchiobdellida (one family, Branchiobdellidae - the crayfish worms, including representatives of the subfamilies Bdellodrilinae, Cambarincolinae, and Xironodrilinae); Hirudinida (the leeches, including representatives in five families – Haemopidae, Hirudinidae, Erpobdellidae, Glossiphoniidae, and Piscicolidae); the Oligochaetous Clitellata {'Oligochaeta'}, with representatives of the aquatic microdrile worms (families Enchytraeidae, Haplotaxidae, Lumbriculidae, Naididae {now including the subfamilies in the former family Tubificidae}, and Opistocystidae), and the terrestrial megadrile oligochaetes – earthworms (families Acanthodrilidae, Glossoscolecidae, Komarekionidae, Lumbricidae, Megascolecidae, and Sparganophilidae); and Polychaeta (sand worms, tube worms, or clam worms – primarily marine) including a few representatives of the families Capitellidae and Sabellidae, and Aeolosomatida (one family, Aeolosomatidae – the head-crawling, or suction-feeding worms). 
Acquisition Highlights. An important acquisition for the INHS Annelida Collection in 1986 was the Walter J. Harman collection of terrestrial oligochaetes. The material in this collection, comprised of 1,600 earthworm specimens representing 22 species, 10 genera, and 3 families, was collected by Dr. Harman from 230 sites in central Illinois during his 1956-1958 survey for his doctoral work at the University of Illinois. The information in Harman's thesis, previously unpublished records in Harman's original field notes, and records of other terrestrial oligochaetes collected over the years in Illinois and deposited in the INHS Annelida Collection were recently presented in a publication by Reynolds and Wetzel (2011): Megadrilogica 18 (4): 35-67.

In addition, we have 300 lots of primary and secondary types, 11,500 frozen tissues representing 815 species and 138 families, and a unique historical collection of salmon scales containing some 800,000 samples taken from six species of anadromous salmonids from across the North Pacific Ocean over a 55-year period.

Our early life history stages cover the entire breadth of the North Pacific, Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, and Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean.

About 15% are freshwater from Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, British Columbia, and California. Our early life history stages cover the entire breadth of the North Pacific, Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, and Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean. We also have a unique collection of freshwater and inshore marine fishes from all 24 of the larger islands of the Russian Kuril Archipelago, including Kamchatka and Sakhalin Island: 59,289 specimens in 1,749 lots, representing 139 species in 86 genera and 22 families.&entry.879476273=Our holdings as of April 2015 include 169,014 (54,236 juveniles and adults; 114,778 eggs and larvae) computer-cataloged lots, the oldest dating back to 1862; and 8,348,483 (384,801 juveniles and adults, and 7,963,682 eggs and larvae) computer-cataloged specimens—in all representing 4,034 species in 1,383 genera and 326 families. In addition, we have 300 lots of primary and secondary types, 11,500 frozen tissues representing 815 species and 138 families, and a unique historical collection of salmon scales containing some 800,000 samples taken from six species of anadromous salmonids from across the North Pacific Ocean over a 55-year period. We recently added 2.4 million pairs of otoliths collected throughout the eastern North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea by Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) personnel and fishery observers over the past 40 years which represents 83 species in 41 genera and 17 families.&entry.417603227=11 million&entry.1321049572=Katherine P.
